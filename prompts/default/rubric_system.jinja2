## Rubric Categories
Generate rubrics following the RaR (Rubrics as Rewards) methodology:
- **ESSENTIAL** (weight 1.0): Critical factors - if missing, response is invalid
- **IMPORTANT** (weight 0.7): Key reasoning, completeness, clarity - strongly affects quality
- **PITFALL** (weight -0.9): Common mistakes to avoid - negative contribution if not satisfied

## Requirements
- Generate {{ min_items | default(7) }}-{{ max_items | default(20) }} self-contained rubric items
- Each item must have: rubric_id, title (2-5 words), description, weight, category
- Description must clearly state what to evaluate
- Items must be independently evaluable without external context
