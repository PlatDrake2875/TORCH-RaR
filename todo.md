# Goal

This is a research project about augumenting datasets such as https://huggingface.co/datasets/olimpia20/toxicity-dataset-ro-master using the ./Rubrics as Rewards Reinforcement Learning Beyond Verifiable Domains (1).pdf method.  

Here's the following features we need to integrate:

# CRITICAL
[x] Generalised method for generating rubric system/user prompts. The variable parts should be:
- System prompt: tasks, important context
- User prompt: tasks, examples

# HIGH PRIORITY
[x] Cached rubric generation per dataset
[x] Progress bar
[x] Logs generation
